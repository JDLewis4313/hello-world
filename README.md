# hello-world

I am Jermarcus Lewis and I enjoy data analysis, my favorite currently is matlab although R and python are other options. 
Though I am not much into web development, I do have knowledge of html, css, and javascript.
The data I enjoy practicing with is from GenBank, NCBI, and others of the likes. 
Reason being is that DNA analysis is great tool to build skills with logic in computer science to find motifs and domains.

I look forward to receiving feedback and recommendations!
